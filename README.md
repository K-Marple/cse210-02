# Card Guessing
An easy card guessing game. The game starts by showing the value of a card, a number from 1-13. You then get the change to guess if the next card in the stack is higher or lower that the previous one. 100 points are earned for a correct guess, 75 taken away for an incorrect guess. When you get to 0 points the game is over.
